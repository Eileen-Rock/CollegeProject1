# CollegeProject1
#This is a college project where the professor asked for a GUI interface to CRUD visual representations of RNA strands. Because apparently shapes 
#matter as much as order in an RNA strand. Started the project in Java, then jumped it to PHP instead when the professor added 
#a requirement that it run in a browser without install. Less than a month before it was due.
